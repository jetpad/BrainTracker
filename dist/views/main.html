<div class="well"><h2>Reaction Time Tracker</h2><p>This site lets you track your reaction speed over time. Reaction speed is a good indicator of the health of your brain and body. Tracking your reaction time can help you see how diet and lifestyle changes effect your health. Using this site requires a dropbox account. Your reaction time data is saved in a private location to your dropbox account and does not have access to any of your other dropbox files. Using dropbox lets you run tests from multiple devices and locations while the data is all saved together.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6"><h2>Key Press Test</h2><p>Test your reaction time using either the keyboard, mouse/trackpad or touch screen.</p><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="dbService.authenticatedNavigate('/test/')"><div>{{(dbService.isAuthenticated() == true) ?
