### Reaction Time Tracker

This applications tracks your reaction speed over time. Reaction speed is an indicator of the health of your brain and by proxy, the health of your whole body. Using this application will help you see how diet and lifestyle changes effect your health. This application requires a dropbox account. Your reaction time data is saved in a private app location in your account and does not have access to any of your other dropbox files.

Features

- The reaction test works using either the keyboard, mouse/trackpad or touch screen.	 
- It saves the application data to dropbox. That lets you run tests from multiple devices and locations while the data is all collected in one account. 

It originally began as a browser based user interface to Seth Roberts' (http://blog.sethroberts.net) reaction time tracking software. It can run independently of his software or the data can be exported/import into his R application using the R package XYZ_TO_BE_CREATED_AT_A_LATER_DATE.
